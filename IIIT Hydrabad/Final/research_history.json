    "summary": "The understanding of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) evolved across iterations from recognizing it as an emerging open standard for integrating AI assistants with external data sources to a rapidly evolving standard that simplifies AI model integration. The initial focus on standardization and security threats expanded to include context exchange, client-server architecture, and real-world applications. The protocol's importance in context-aware systems, its potential for enhancement with machi"
